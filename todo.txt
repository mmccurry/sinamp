Current Issues:
    When you exit fzf without selecting anything it tries to play everything in the current directory
    You can only select contents of directory that has files in it. 
    No way to select artist folder for instance
    No way to recursively find files and play them so selecting artist file wouldn't do anything anyway

TODO:
    Add shuffle feature
    use arguments so I can select different options
